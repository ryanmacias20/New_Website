<h3>I play a live action role-playing game (LARP) is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically portray their characters.The players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by the real world while interacting with each other in character. The outcome of player actions may be mediated by game rules or determined by consensus among players. Event arrangers called game masters decide the setting and rules to be used and facilitate play. </h3>

<p style="color:dodgerblue;background-color:purple;border:15px solid black;">LARP does not have a single point of origin, but was invented independently by groups in North America, Europe, and Australia. These groups shared an experience with genre fiction or tabletop role-playing games, and a desire to physically experience such settings. In addition to tabletop role-playing, LARP is rooted in childhood games of make believe, play fighting, costume parties, role play simulations, Comedian deliberate, improvisational theater, psychodrama, military simulations, and historical reenactment groups such as the Society for Creative Anachronism.</p>
<p> The participants in a LARP physically portray characters in a fictional setting, improvising their characters' speech and movements somewhat like actors in improvisational theatre. This is distinct from tabletop role-playing games, where character actions are described verbally.</p>
